# OathChatBotHackathon

Running `python parrotbot.py` will start the chatbot that you can then interact with. Start by greeting it and it will help you through suggesting a movie for you to watch. It reads from the O2 AOL API and returns trailers that you can watch. It will also understand a lot of other things you say to it and will gracefully handle the things that don't make sense in context ;)
